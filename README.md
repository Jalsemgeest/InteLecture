===========

The purpose of this site is give the ability for students to attend lectures while not in a lecture hall.
It was built in 4 days.  It was for a project in an intro to web design course.  Therefore some of the security may not be fully up to par.  If there are any bugs I would happily update it.

If there are an suggestions or anyone would like to use anything of this please let me know.
